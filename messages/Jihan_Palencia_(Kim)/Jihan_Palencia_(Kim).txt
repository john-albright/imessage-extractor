I completely forgot and everything has been such a blur. :/ Yes, the baby arrived on April 30th! Theodore Ezra Kim. All I gotta say is parenthood is friggin hard. Haha. I respect all existing parents so much. Hereâ€™s the most recent pic of Theo. And you could totally be his live-in Spanish-speaking nanny. Haha.IMG_1179.JPG

Weâ€™re on our first trip out of state with Theo and itâ€™s a bit stressful because heâ€™s gotten sick but weâ€™re still enjoying time with family. We would love to see you if you come visit again. Take care, dear friend. Merry Christmas. ðŸ˜˜IMG_9260.jpeg
